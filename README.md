# project A, personal portfolio site

a deployable developer portfolio built with next.js 15, tailwind, and magic UI components. driven end-to-end by claude code with MCPs doing the heavy lifting (docs lookup, repo creation, deployment).


## stack
- next.js 15 (App Router, typescript)
- tailwind CSS
- magic UI components (via the `magic` MCP)
- deployed to vercel

## MCPs used
- `context7`, live next.js and magic UI docs
- `github`, create the repo and push
- `vercel`, deploy
- `magic`, magic UI component catalog

## subagents used
- `ui-designer`, for styling decisions and component picks

## skills used
- `everything-claude-code-conventions`, consistent commit messages

## how to start
1. fill in the brackets in [`PROMPT.md`](./PROMPT.md)
2. launch claude code from this folder: `claude`
3. paste your customized prompt
4. follow along and iterate

full walkthrough is in the root [`GUIDE.md`](../../GUIDE.md) → section 6.

## when you're done
your live URL should work on both desktop and mobile, feature 3 real projects from your own work, and use at least 2 magic UI components. see the "done checklist" at the bottom of `PROMPT.md`.
